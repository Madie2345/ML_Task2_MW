class Car:
    """
1. This Function is a class constructor, setting up the car with its basic features.
The __init__ method starts a new instance of the car. The first 3 lines load the image of the car, scale it to the parameters that are set earlier (CAR_SIZE_X and CAR_SIZE_Y, lines 21, 22) and rotate the sprite. The next 3 lines set the starting position of the car in pixels on the screen. It should line up with where the start line is on the map. The self.speed_set variable flags whether or not the speed of the cars can change. It is set to false so that the default speed for the cars can be changed later on, as they may choose to go faster to prioritise distance/time or slower to try and survive. The center of the car is then calculated so that the radars can be attached to the center later on. It is found using the average of the position and the car size, both X and Y. Then, the radars are introduced and drawn. The radars are used for the car to have a sense of the track and where the paths end. After the car is set up, self.alive is set to true. This boolean variable checks if the car has crashed, once it has it is set to false and is no longer in the game. It must be set back to true in order for the cars to reappear and retry. Finally, the distance driven and time passed are reset to 0, which is important because the new generation of cars has not tested their abilities and their reward should not yet be there.

This function is necessary because without the car appearing in the simulation, nothing else would work, as the car one of the main features of the game, along with the track. Multiple cars are created at the start of each generation for the best chance of some of them improving their performance, which is tracked by the variables self.distance and self.time.

2. This Function draws the car on the screen using pygame. Blit is another term for a sprite. The previous function sets up the car, however never actually gets it to appear, which is what this one does. screen.blit is used to add self.rotated_sprite and self.position to the screen and then the radars are drawn to the screen using self.draw_radar(screen).

This function is necessary because for the simulation to appear and work, the cars have to be on the screen. The radars being seen is not as important, however it is useful to see more of what might be going on with the cars. This function is used every time a new generation is needed, because in each generation, new cars must appear.

3. This Function draws all of the radars that check for collisions. It has a for loop for the radars to be drawn in different positions. Their lines are drawn from the center of the car using the self.center variable which was calculated in function 1. The circles are drawn at the end of the lines furthest from the car. The cars have 5 radars, one in front, one diagonally in front either way and one left and right of the car. These different positions are drawn using the loop, as each time the loop runs, a different radar is drawn. The direction it points is found in the 1st index of each object in the self.radars array.

The radars being drawn isn't essential to the simulation, it just provides more details about what the code may be doing. New radars are drawn for each car when it is created.

            pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 255, 0), position, 5)

    """ 
4. This Function checks if a car has had a collision. It takes in the parameters self and game_map, and first sets self.alive to true because it cannot check if a car that has died has collided. It is forever checking if the car has crashed, so needs to make sure that self.alive stays true until then. The function loops through the coordinates of the pixels on the corners of the car, assuming that it is rectangular (only these are needed as it is near impossible for an edge to escape the track without at least one of the corners doing so). Assuming that the car is rectuangular is benefitial as it saves so many loops from being needed, simplifying the function, and is quite practical as the car is close enough in shape to assume that if the rectangle goes out, it will too. The if statement in this code is checking if any of the corners of the car's bounding box (represented by self.corners) touch a border on the game map. If it finds that any corner is touching a border (which is indicated by the color of the pixel at that corner's location being the same as BORDER_COLOR), it sets self.alive to false, rendering the car in question dead.

This is one of the most essential functions for the simulation to actually happen, as the goal is to train the cars to drive around a track without colliding, and to do so, we need to know if a car has collided and remove it. It is used throughout the entire similulation, constantly checking if each individual car has crashed into the border of the track.

5. This Function creates an actual use for the radars that were drawn earlier. The x and y variables calculate the radars location based on the cars current angle and center, using trigonometry. The while loop is the primary part of this function, using the radars to continuously scan until one of two conditions are meant: radar hits a border colour (indicating that it has detected an obstacle/ boundary) or the length exceeds 300 units (so the radar doesn't scan indefinetely). Within the loop, length is increased by one each iteration, and the x and y values of the radar are updated so that the radar moves further from the car until the border is detected, or the length limit is reached. The final part of this function involves calculating the distance from the center of the car to the point where a radar can scan a border/ meet the length limit using the Euclidean formula. This is then appended to the self.radars list.

This function is necessary because it creates more of a use for the radars, which allow the car to sense obstacles. Later on, these calculations to sense obstacles are used to allow the cars to learn to steer away from them and improve their overall fitness.

6. This Function sets the original speed for the first generation of the cars and updates the cars speed, position, rotation and collision detection throughout the simulation. This function starts by setting the car's speed to 20, but only if it hasn't been set before (initial speed). Then, the sprite (blit) image is rotated and the x position of the car is updated using trigonometric functions sin and cos to move it in the direction of the specified angle. Due to limits max and min of the position, the cars x position is limited within the game map. Distance and time is increased, which is important as it is the reward system for the car. The same occurs for the y position of the car. A new center of the car is calculated by averaging the x and y values of the car. The 4 corners of the cars hit-box are recalculated based on the updated position. The check collision function is called to check if the car has crashed during it's movements and the stored data in the radars list is cleared, allowing for the process to repeat. The last part of the function loops through degrees in steps of 45 degrees, each time calling the check_radar function to perform a scan in that direction.

This function is essential because it allows the simulation to run continuously, moving the car on the screen and updating its position so that the radars can scan for new objects, and so that the check_collision function can use the cars cooridinates to check for collisions.

""" This Function:
Empty Collections Initialization: Two lists, nets and cars, are initialized. nets will hold the neural networks corresponding to each genome, while cars will store instances of the Car class. These collections are essential for tracking and controlling the simulation's neural network-car interactions.

Initializing PyGame and Display: The Pygame library is initialized, and a display window is created with the specified dimensions (WIDTH and HEIGHT). This step sets up the graphical environment for the simulation, enabling the rendering of game elements and user interactions.

Creating Neural Networks and Cars: For each genome passed into the run_simulation function, a neural network is generated using the 'neat.nn.FeedForwardNetwork.create(g, config)' method. This network is associated with a specific genome and configuration. The neural network is added to the nets list, and the genome's fitness is initialized to zero. Additionally, a new instance of the Car class is created and added to the cars list. These cars will be controlled by their respective neural networks during the simulation.

Clock and Font Settings: The code establishes a Pygame clock to regulate the frame rate of the simulation, ensuring that it runs at a consistent speed. Different fonts are loaded to display information on the screen, enhancing the user's understanding of the simulation's progress.

Updating the Generation Counter: The current_generation global variable is incremented, reflecting the current generation being simulated. This provides a reference point for tracking the progress of the NEAT algorithm.

Main Simulation Loop: The core of the simulation is a loop that runs indefinitely, managing the behavior of each car and updating their associated neural networks. This loop forms the backbone of the NEAT algorithm's execution.

Event Handling: Within the loop, the code processes Pygame events. It checks for user interactions, such as closing the window or pressing the escape key, allowing users to control the simulation's execution.

Car Actions and Neural Network Activation: For each car, the neural network is activated with the car's sensor data, obtained using nets[i].activate(car.get_data()). The highest value in the neural network's output determines the car's action, whether it should turn left, turn right, slow down, or speed up. This step enables the neural networks to influence the cars' movements.

Updating Fitness and Car Movement: For cars that are still alive, their fitness scores are increased based on their progress, and their positions and movements are updated accordingly. This step is crucial for training the neural networks to improve car performance.

Checking Car Survival: The code counts the number of cars that are still alive in the simulation. If no cars remain alive, indicating that the simulation has reached its termination condition, the simulation loop is exited.

Time Limit for Simulation: A simple counter is used to roughly limit the duration of the simulation. In this case, the counter helps prevent the simulation from running indefinitely and ensures it ends after a predefined duration.

Drawing the Game Environment: Within the loop, the code draws the game map onto the screen. Additionally, for each alive car, it renders the car's image on the screen, visualizing their movements and interactions with the environment.

Displaying Information: The code displays textual information about the current generation, the number of cars still alive, and the mean fitness of the population. These details offer insights into the simulation's progress and the performance of evolving neural networks.

Updating Display and Frame Rate: After drawing the game environment and information, the display is updated to reflect these changes. The frame rate is controlled using the Pygame clock, ensuring a maximum of 60 frames per second for smooth and consistent simulation playback.

""" This Section: entry point for the script, ensuring that the contained code executes only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.

The configuration settings defined in the config.txt file are loaded into the config variable using neat.Config(). The various components include neat.DefaultGenome, which specifies options controlling genome characteristics such as node activation, bias, connection management, and architecture. Additionally, parameters like num_hidden, num_inputs, and num_outputs collectively define the neural network's structure.

neat.DefaultReproduction defines settings related to genome reproduction, including the number of elite genomes (elitism) directly passed to the next generation and the survival_threshold that determines which genomes are considered for reproduction.

neat.DefaultSpeciesSet sets the compatibility threshold (compatibility_threshold) used to distinguish species, while neat.DefaultStagnation defines parameters such as the species fitness function (species_fitness_func), maximum stagnation generations (max_stagnation), and species elitism (species_elitism).

By encapsulating these configurations within the config variable, this section establishes the foundation for the NEAT algorithm's behavior and species management, necessary for guiding the evolution of neural networks controlling the simulated cars.

In the other part of this section, 'neat.StdOutReporter(True)' is added to allow real-time updates to be printed to the console. This report provides information on the status of each generation as they are simulated.

Additionally, a neat.StatisticsReporter() is added to collect various evolution statistics. This reporter helps monitor and record data such as the mean fitness of the population and other relevant metrics throughout the simulation.

Finally, the population.run(run_simulation, 1000) statement initiates the NEAT algorithm to run the simulation for a maximum of 1000 generations. During this process, the population of neural networks evolves, and the provided run_simulation function controls the behavior of the simulated cars.

This section is essential as it serves as the main driver for running the NEAT algorithm and simulating the evolution of neural networks controlling the cars.
